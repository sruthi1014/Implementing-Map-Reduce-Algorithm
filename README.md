### Introduction
The objective of this mini project is to find the words and their count by implementing mapper reducer algorithm in Python.
[Map Reduce implementation](https://github.com/sruthi1014/Implementing-Map-Reduce-Algorithm/blob/master/Map_reduce_implementation.ipynb) file has the code for the algorithms written.

### Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python
* **Packages**  NLTK, Pandas

### Data
Text from the book "Prejudice" by Jane Austin is the dataset used in this project.

### Functions
* Mapper
* Sorter
* Partition
* Reducer
* Multi Threading

### Approach:
1. Data cleaning
2. Call the functions mentioned above to process the data and achieve the results
3. Results
